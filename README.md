# pytorch_basics
the very beginning of learning pytorch.

`tensors`: some practice of tensors.

`linear_regression`: linear regression with pytorch.

`data/mnist-train7k-val3k`: The label indicates what the number is. The integer value of each pixel ranges from (0 to 255), representing the gray value of that pixel. Since each image is 28 *28 in size, there are a total of 784 pixels (pixel0-pixel783).
